# Bangladesh Election 2026 — Economic & Electoral Analysis

A data-driven analysis of the 13th National Parliamentary Election of Bangladesh (2026), examining the relationship between regional economic indicators and electoral outcomes.

This repository contains an end-to-end pipeline for scraping election results, processing economic data (HIES 2022), performing weighted regional analysis, and modeling voting patterns using machine learning.

## Project Overview

This project investigates whether divisional income and expenditure levels are associated with political alignment. The workflow includes:

* Automated scraping of seat-wise election results (300 constituencies)
* Cleaning and aggregation of divisional economic indicators
* Weighted voter impact analysis by division
* Decision Tree classification to identify key predictive features
* Generation of analytical visualizations

## Key Findings

* Higher-expenditure divisions show stronger alignment with the BNP-led alliance.
* Lower-expenditure divisions demonstrate greater support for the Jamaat-led alliance (11PA).
* Consumption expenditure is the dominant predictive feature in the Decision Tree model.
* High-population divisions (e.g., Dhaka and Chattogram) exert disproportionate influence on the national outcome due to voter weight.

## Installation & Execution

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the full pipeline:

```bash
python main.py
```

If `data/raw_election_data.csv` is not generated automatically, add division names manually after scraping.
